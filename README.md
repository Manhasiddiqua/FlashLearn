# FlashLearn
Learn fast, with FlashLearn

## Inspiration
We were both inspired by the difficulty we are facing right now with learning french in high school. We both use flashcards to study on a daily basis, but using a program would be much more environmentally friendly and efficient. Both of us which to travel the world one day, but if we donâ€™t get constant practice, it will be hard to achieve that dream.

## What it does
FlashLearn is a program which generates 50 randomized words in different languages. Simply pick the native language of the user and the language that wish to learn to create words which will prompt the user for the translation. If having difficulty, the program will allow the user to receive hints of the word and ultimately display the word at the bottom. 

## How we built it
We built FlashLearn using a python GUI called Tkinter. This GUI helped make our user interface more friendly and visually interactive. 

## Challenges we ran into
A challenge we ran into was taking our python code, upgrading it into Tkinter and adding style elements such as the answer bar and the functioning buttons. However, we are very proud that we were able to prevail over these challenges, and have a fully working demo! 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
This was our first time using a GUI in our code, and we are very proud to have been able to take that next step of making our program visually appealing and interactive. 

## What we learned
We were both unfamiliar with GitHub and the process of creating Github Repositories so we spent a while learning about them and finally being able to create our own. We also learn about Python Tkinter and how to code on it as we are both unfamiliar with it, yet it all worked out in the end and ended up having a lot of fun along the way.

## What's next for FlashLearn
We hope to expand the vocabulary available in each language we offer, plus expand to more languages so that FlashLearn can be an environment that can be used by all.
